                <p>
                    <i>To provide highly effective websites for all walks of life</i>
                </p>
                <p>Over a year ago I left my job and pursued a skill that would help me find passion and fulfill my desire
                    to learn. After much research and plenty of typing code I now have aquired the skills I needed to build
                    amazing websites and android applications. Choosing me to build your website will not only get you an
                    awesome website, but also you are personally helping me stay on my path and continue to invest in myself.
                    Thank you for visitng my site and I hope to work with you very soon!

                <p>CSS Styling will make your website beautiful and organized. Turn a boring static website into a modern
                    responsive website. Over 60% of the web is viewed through a mobile device. With CSS styling you will
                    have a website that looks good on any screen-size!

                <p>JavaScript will take your website to the next level. While HTML5 and CSS do most of the work, JavaScript
                    will make your site modern and extremely pleasing to the users. JS can bring functionality and give you
                    the edge needed to stand out!
